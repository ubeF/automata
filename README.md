# Automata

This library is written as i follow along my course in "Formal Languages and Automata" at DHBW Stuttgart.
It's an attempt to realize the learned theoretical concepts in code and is meant purely for educational purposes.

At the same time it's my first real Haskell project.
This library will therefore be extended and improved upon as i learn more about automata, formal languages and Haskell.

Currently implemented features:
  - Creation of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
  - Evaluation of DFAs
  - Creation of Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
  - Evaluation of NFAs
  - Conversion from NFAs to DFAs

Currently planned features:
  - [ ] Minimization of DFAs
  - [ ] Automatic creation of NFAs from Regular Expressions
